Hey DisCorkie Community! ðŸ‘‹

We're excited to bring you the latest update for DisCorkie, **version 1.6.0**! Our goal with this release was to make your experience even smoother and more intuitive, especially when you're connecting to new communities or simply navigating your favorite ones. We've introduced a helpful new feature to simplify adding forums and made several important improvements behind the scenes to keep the app running reliably.

We're always listening to your feedback and working to make DisCorkie the best companion for your Discourse forums. Let's dive into what's new in this version!

## ðŸŒŸ What's New & Improved in DisCorkie 1.6.0

This update brings thoughtful enhancements designed to make your daily use of DisCorkie more seamless and enjoyable:

### A Simpler Flow for Adding Forums by Web Address

Connecting to new communities should always be straightforward. Weâ€™ve redesigned the process for adding a forum directly by its web address to be more intuitive and user-friendly. This updated flow guides you effortlessly through the steps, making it quicker and easier to get set up with a new community and jump into discussions.

### Access Forums That Require Login

This is a significant enhancement! You can now effortlessly add and access Discourse forums that require you to be logged in before viewing their content. This capability works whether youâ€™re adding a forum by its web address or through search. This opens up even more of your private or members-only communities directly within DisCorkie, allowing you to connect with more of your online spaces.

### **Clearer Language for Everyone**

DisCorkie is used by people all over the world, and we want to ensure everyone has a great experience. In this update, we've refreshed and updated our translations. This means DisCorkie is now clearer and more accessible across various languages, making it easier for our diverse global community to understand and use the app.

## ðŸ›  Behind the Scenes Enhancements for a Better App

While you'll love the new forum addition flow, a lot of work has also gone into making DisCorkie more stable and efficient under the hood. These improvements might not be immediately visible, but they contribute to a more dependable and polished app experience:

**Smoother Navigation and Display** We've addressed an issue related to how certain layout elements and navigation components (like the "Aside" sections) are displayed. This fix ensures that the app's interface is more consistent and polished as you move between different sections and forums, contributing to a more seamless visual experience.

**Enhanced Performance & Stability** This release includes updates to various internal components and libraries that power DisCorkie. Think of these as upgrades to the app's engine â€“ they help everything run more efficiently, reduce unexpected hiccups, and provide a generally more stable and reliable experience. You should notice fewer interruptions and a more consistent performance overall.

### Ready to Experience the Update?

We encourage you to update your DisCorkie app today to enjoy these enhancements. A more stable and user-friendly app means a better experience for everyone, whether you're adding a new forum or catching up on your daily discussions.
