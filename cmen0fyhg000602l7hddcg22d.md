We've been listening to your feedback and working to make your forum companion more refined, smoother, and intuitive. Get ready to explore your communities with a fresh perspective and some useful new enhancements.

This update focuses on making your daily forum dives easier and more enjoyable, whether you're catching up on recent activity or searching for specific discussions. Let's look at what's new!

## üåü What's New & Improved in DisCorkie 1.5.0

Finding what matters most is now more efficient and intuitive. Your Home Screen has been upgraded with clear, easy-to-use tabs like **New**, **Latest**, and **Hot**. Want to see the newest posts across your communities? Tap "New." Curious about recently active discussions? "Latest" has you covered. Looking for what's trending and generating buzz? "Hot" is your go-to! This makes jumping into the topics you care about simpler, saving you time and keeping you connected to the pulse of your communities.

**Refined Profile Details** We've polished how user profiles are displayed within the app. Now, bios and other user information will appear more reliably and consistently, giving you a clearer picture of who you're interacting with across your various forums.

**More Accurate Forum Activity Data** Keeping track of what's happening in your communities is important. We've improved the accuracy of forum activity data, so you get a more precise and up-to-date view of discussions and engagement within your connected forums.

### üõ† What We've Fixed for a Smoother Ride

Beyond the new features, we've also been busy under the hood, addressing issues and boosting performance to help ensure DisCorkie performs reliably:

We've addressed several minor issues to enhance the overall stability of the app, meaning fewer hiccups and a more consistent experience for you as you navigate your forums. Specific fixes have been implemented to ensure data structures for basic information responses are robust, contributing to the app's reliability. Additionally, issues related to "last activity data" have been resolved, further improving the accuracy of forum insights you see.

### üåç Global Reach & Continuous Care

We're committed to making DisCorkie accessible to everyone, everywhere. This version includes **updated translations** that make the app clearer and more user-friendly for our diverse global community. Your feedback helps us make DisCorkie better for all!
