Hey DisCorkie Enthusiasts! üëã

Get ready for some awesome news: DisCorkie has just leveled up! We've been busy tinkering under the hood and are excited to roll out an update that makes managing your many Discourse communities smoother, faster, and even more user-friendly. We're talking a cool new way to boost your Android experience, more languages, and a bunch of tweaks to keep things zipping along.

We know you love staying connected to your favorite online communities without the fuss, and this update is all about making that experience even better.

### So, What's Freshly Baked in DisCorkie 1.4.0?

#### üöÄ DisCorkie Plus Hits Android!

First up, Android users, you‚Äôre in for a treat! We‚Äôre thrilled to introduce **DisCorkie Plus** ‚Äì our brand-new premium offering designed specifically for our Android community. Think of it as the DisCorkie you know and love, but with extra sprinkles on top!

So, what‚Äôs the biggest perk? With DisCorkie Plus, you can **add an unlimited number of Discourse forums** to your app! If you're managing or participating in a multitude of communities, this is a game-changer. The free version of DisCorkie allows you to add up to two forums, which is great for casual use, but DisCorkie Plus unlocks the full potential for our power users.

Beyond unlimited forums, DisCorkie Plus is packed with advanced features designed to give you even more power and flexibility as you juggle your Discourse communities on the move, all from that one trusty app.

#### üåç ¬°Hola! Bonjour! More Languages Onboard!

DisCorkie is now even better at speaking your language (literally!). We believe in making DisCorkie accessible to everyone, everywhere. That's why we‚Äôve expanded our translations to include:

* Afrikaans
    
* Arabic (for UAE, Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia)
    
* Azerbaijani
    
* Bavarian
    
* Belarusian
    

So, go ahead and navigate your forums like a true polyglot!

### ‚ú® Slicker, Faster, Better ‚Äì Across the Board!

#### Keeping Things Speedy and Stable

We‚Äôre always on a mission to make DisCorkie the slickest Discourse client out there. This update is crammed with under-the-hood goodness to make the app faster, lighter on resources, and rock-solid stable across all your devices (Yep, that‚Äôs Android, iOS, Linux, and Windows!).

Expect even smoother sailing as you navigate your forums ‚Äì no more digital hiccups! We've also been doing some internal spring cleaning and planning. This not only improves the current version but also paves the way for even cooler features down the line. We're committed to making DisCorkie keep getting better *with* you.
